# Strong empirical evidence of incentives for bycatch mitigation across major bycatch taxa

This is a contribution to the themed article set (TS) *Challenges to incentivising avoidance of unwanted catch* from the ICES Journal of Marine Science. Much of this research was conceived after reading the thought provoking "call for papers" email sent out by the organizers of this TS, which outlined current difficulties to eliminate bycatch in commercial fisheries at the global scale.

## Instructions
Go to [Quick View](#Quick-View) for a one-minute-or-less summary of this study. In *Quick View*, a non-technical but at the same time insightful view of the major contributions of this study is provided. What is missing in the *Quick View* is the technical details, dry and boring to many but, nontheless, curcial to arrive at those results and conclusions. For those eager to dig into the technical details, go to [Full Story](#Full-Story) for more. Over there, the set of technical problems arised in this study is discussed, and the original data and source code are also provided. If you haven't read [the article](#) yet, reading this Readme first probably will make that article much easier to read. If you have already read that article, you may check your understandings here. 

Note that nothing is lost, in the sense of undertanding the ramifications to bycatch mitigation, in just reading the *Quick View*; in the same sense, no additional insight on bycatch mitigation can be gained in reading the *Full Story*. This is not to encourage readers to ignore the technical details, but to ease the uncomfortable feeling that something important might be missing by not perusing every single detail for general audiences, such as commercial fishers or fishery managers.
